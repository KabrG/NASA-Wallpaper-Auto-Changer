# NASA-Wallpaper-Auto-Changer
 
## Description
NASA posts a daily astronomy photo of the day. The goal for this project was to automate changing my desktop wallpaper background daily while posting the explanation on a Tkinter window for display. I used python to change the wallpaper itself and CronJob to schedule the execution daily.

For this project, my MacOS wallpaper refreshes at 00:10
